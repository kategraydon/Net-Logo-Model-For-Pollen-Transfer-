In here, you will find my code for simulating honeybee foraging strategies in NetLogo. The simplest version of the model exists in "Basic_Foragers.netlogox", with comments containing the logic for each section and troubleshooting issues. This model contains entirely constant bees, foraging in a world with equally rewarding flowers.
Then, each version of the model has incrementally introduced a new behaviour, such as introducing variations in foraging strategies (floral constancy), pollen transfer and so fourth...
